All values should be percentages, or a scale from 1-10 if you prefer conceptually.

Results to generate:
    • Value - How useful is this concept to an average person?
    • Stickiness - How likely is a user to keep using this product, once they start?
    • Virality - How likely is a user to share this with their connections?
        Virality = 
    • Understandability - How easy is this concept to understand?
        Understandability = (1-complexity)*design_quality

Configs to play with:
    • Cost - Does this concept have a monetary cost to use it?
    • Market size - What percent of the total network will inherently have interest in the concept, given perfect understandability?
    • Design Quality - How quality is the design of this concept?
    • Complexity - How complex is the concept?
    • Share aggressiveness - How aggressively does the concept attempt to spread to others?
    • Core Usefulness - Is this something a user inherently needs to use? e.g. "Cat Videos" on the low end, "Banking app" on the high end.
