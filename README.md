virality
========

A few years ago I was playing around with creating a satirical web game called The Silicon Trail. It'd be a business simulator game like [Aerobiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobiz), where you'd be in control of a social software startup and you'd need to make it successful.

This was junk code that I wrote to simulate factors of "success of social software". I'm really just open sourcing it so I can keep it around and still stay in the Small plan limits on GitHub.

This is licensed on WTFPL Version 2.0. If you're going to make The Silicon Trail though, a credit would be nice.
